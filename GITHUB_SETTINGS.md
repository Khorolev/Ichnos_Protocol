# GitHub Repository Settings Reference

Complete configuration guide for the Ichnos Protocol GitHub repository. This document assumes the repository may have been previously configured with different settings (e.g., a 4-branch model, staging branches, or different status checks) and walks through a clean setup from scratch.

> **This is the authoritative source** for GitHub repository settings. [`DEPLOYMENT_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`](DEPLOYMENT_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) references this file for quick-reference summaries.

## Overview — What Must Be Configured

The GitHub repository requires the following settings to support the 2-branch deployment model (`feature/* → main → release`):

| Area | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Repository Secrets** | 10 secrets for CI/E2E + 4 additional secrets for production promotion (14 total) | CI/E2E workflows need database and test accounts; production promotion workflows need Vercel API access |
| **Environments** | `production` environment with required reviewers | Production promotion workflow pauses for human approval before deploying |
| **Branch Protections** | `main` (5 required checks + PR required) and `release` (1 required check + PR required) | Enforces the CI → Preview → E2E → merge pipeline and the `main`-only release policy |
| **Old Rule Cleanup** | Remove stale branch protections and rulesets from previous configurations | Stale rules (e.g., for `staging`, `e2e-testing`, or different check names) can block merges or silently bypass the pipeline |
| **Auto-Merge** (optional) | Allow auto-merge at the repository level | Enables automatic merge of `main → release` PRs once the `Release Policy Check` passes |

---

## 1. Clean Up Old Rules

If this repository was previously configured with different branch protections (e.g., a 4-branch model with `staging` or `e2e-testing` branches), clean up stale rules first. **Skip this section for a fresh repository.**

### Step 1 — Remove stale branch protection rules

1. Go to **Settings → Branches**.
2. For each existing branch protection rule, check whether the **Branch name pattern** matches a branch that no longer exists in the 2-branch model (e.g., `staging`, `e2e-testing`, `develop`).
3. Delete any rule that does not apply to `main` or `release`.

### Step 2 — Remove stale rulesets

1. Go to **Settings → Rules → Rulesets**.
2. Review each ruleset. Delete any that reference branches other than `main` or `release`, or that reference status check names no longer used (e.g., old CI job names).

### Step 3 — Verify no orphan required status checks on `main`

1. Open the existing `main` branch protection rule (or ruleset).
2. Under **Required status checks**, remove any check names that do not match the 5 checks listed in §4 below.
3. Old check names (e.g., `build`, `test`, `ci`, `deploy-preview`) will block all PRs if left in place because no workflow produces them.

> **If you previously had `Preflight — Secret Validation`, `Deploy Client Preview`, or `Deploy Server Preview` as required checks on `main`, these must be removed — no workflow produces these check names anymore. These were from the legacy CLI-driven preview deployment model.**

### Step 4 — Verify no orphan required status checks on `release`

1. Open the existing `release` branch protection rule (or ruleset).
2. The only required status check should be `Release Policy Check`. Remove any others.

## 2. Repository Secrets

Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** and add each secret listed below.

### Database Secrets

| Secret | Description | Where to Find |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (used by E2E seed step) | Neon Tech → Project → Connection Details |

### E2E Test Account Secrets

Three test accounts are required for Playwright E2E tests. Each account must be pre-created in Firebase Authentication.

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Admin test account email |
| `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin test account password |
| `E2E_ADMIN_UID` | Admin test account Firebase UID |
| `E2E_USER_EMAIL` | Regular user test account email |
| `E2E_USER_PASSWORD` | Regular user test account password |
| `E2E_USER_UID` | Regular user test account Firebase UID |
| `E2E_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Super-admin test account email |
| `E2E_SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Super-admin test account password |
| `E2E_SUPER_ADMIN_UID` | Super-admin test account Firebase UID |

### Production Promotion Secrets

These 4 secrets are **required** for the production promotion workflows (`promote-to-production.yml` and `vercel-promote-production.yml`). They are not needed for preview deployments (handled by Vercel's native Git integration) or for CI/E2E workflows.

| Secret | Description | Where to Find |
|---|---|---|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Vercel API token for CLI and API access | Vercel → Account Settings → Tokens |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Vercel team/org ID | Vercel → Team Settings → General → Team ID |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_CLIENT` | Vercel project ID for the client app | Vercel → Project Settings → General → Project ID |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_SERVER` | Vercel project ID for the server app | Vercel → Project Settings → General → Project ID |

> **Without these 4 secrets, merging into `release` will trigger `promote-to-production.yml` which will fail.** If you only need preview deployments and CI/E2E (no production promotion via GitHub Actions), you can omit these secrets and promote manually via the Vercel dashboard instead.

---

## 3. Environments

### Create the `production` environment

1. Go to **Settings → Environments → New environment**.
2. Name it exactly `production`.
3. Under **Deployment protection rules**, enable **Required reviewers** and add at least one reviewer.
4. Save.

> Both `promote-to-production.yml` and `vercel-promote-production.yml` target `environment: production`. Without this environment configured, promotions run without approval — which defeats the purpose of the gate.

---

## 4. Branch Protections

Configure branch protection rules in **Settings → Branches** (or **Settings → Rules → Rulesets**).

### `main` branch

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Require a pull request before merging | Yes |
| Required status checks | `Client — Lint & Test`, `Server — Lint & Test`, `<your-client-vercel-check>`, `<your-server-vercel-check>`, `E2E Tests (Playwright)` |
| Require branches to be up to date before merging | Recommended |
| Include administrators | Recommended (see §6 for trade-offs) |

> **Required checks explained:**
>
> - **`Client — Lint & Test`** and **`Server — Lint & Test`**: Produced by `ci.yml`. Run linting, unit tests, and client build verification.
> - **Vercel deployment checks** (e.g., `Vercel – ichnos-protocol` and `Vercel – ichnos-protocol-server`): Produced by Vercel's native Git integration. These checks confirm that preview deployments build and deploy successfully. **The exact check names are determined by your Vercel project names and may differ from the examples shown here.** To find the correct names: open a recent PR, scroll to the status checks section, and copy the exact Vercel check context strings. Use those exact strings when configuring required status checks — a mismatch will block all merges.
> - **`E2E Tests (Playwright)`**: Produced by `e2e-on-preview.yml`. Triggered by `deployment_status` events after Vercel completes a preview deployment. For client deployments, Playwright tests execute. For server deployments, the job succeeds immediately without running tests — this is intentional so the required status check is satisfied for both deployment events. See [`DEPLOYMENT_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`](DEPLOYMENT_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) §3 for full hostname-based routing details.

### `release` branch

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Require a pull request before merging | Yes |
| Required status checks | `Release Policy Check` |
| Include administrators | Recommended |

> **Important:** GitHub Actions check names are frozen in workflow file headers (the `name:` field of each job). Do not rename jobs in workflow YAML without updating the corresponding branch protection rules here. `E2E Tests (Playwright)` is produced by `e2e-on-preview.yml`. Vercel check names are determined by your Vercel project names — always copy the exact context string from a recent PR's checks tab before configuring branch protection rules.

---

## 5. Auto-Merge

Auto-merge can be enabled at the repository level (**Settings → General → Allow auto-merge**) so that PRs are merged automatically once all required checks pass. This is optional but useful for the `main → release` PR flow where the only gate is the `Release Policy Check`.

If enabled:
- The PR author must explicitly enable auto-merge on each PR (it does not happen globally).
- All required status checks must still pass before the merge executes.
- Required reviewers (if configured) must still approve.

---

## 6. Admin Bypass

> **Accepted Limitation**: Branch sequence (`feature/* → main → release`) is enforced via GitHub rulesets and branch protection settings. This provides strong governance enforcement but is **not an absolute, non-bypassable lineage proof** in all edge cases (e.g., a repository admin with bypass permissions could merge out of sequence). This is an explicitly accepted trade-off in favor of platform-native governance over a custom policy-check workflow.

**Recommendation:** Enable "Include administrators" on both `main` and `release` branch protections so that admins cannot accidentally bypass the pipeline. Admins can temporarily disable this setting for emergency hotfixes, but should re-enable it immediately after.
