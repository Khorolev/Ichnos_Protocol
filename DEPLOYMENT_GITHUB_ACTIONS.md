# GitHub Actions Deployment Pipeline

This repository uses a 3-stage deployment pipeline: **CI gate → preview → production**. No code reaches Vercel unless CI passes, and no code reaches production without a human approval on the `release` branch. E2E tests run on every PR branch (not only after merging to `main`), and merge is blocked until E2E passes.

    CI-->>VP: workflow_run (success, any branch)
    VP-->>GH: Preview URL ready (artifact: client-preview-url)
    VP-->>E2E: workflow_run (success) — E2E retrieves URL from artifact

    Dev->>GH: Merge PR into main (blocked until E2E passes)
    Dev->>Rel: Push commit to release branch 🔴
    Rel->>GH: promote-to-production triggers
    GH-->>Dev: Awaiting approval (production environment) 🔴
    Dev->>GH: Approve 🔴
    GH->>Prod: Vercel promotes latest READY preview → production

## 2. Workflows

| Workflow file | Name | Trigger | Purpose | Gate / Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | CI | `push` to `main`; `pull_request` targeting `main` | Lint, test, build for `client/` and `server/` | None — always runs |
| `vercel-preview-on-main.yml` | Vercel Preview | `workflow_run` on CI completed (any branch) | Deploy both apps to Vercel preview | Only runs if CI concluded `success` **and** the triggering run originated from the same repository (fork PRs are excluded to prevent secret exfiltration) |
| `e2e.yml` | E2E Tests (Playwright) | `workflow_run` on `Vercel Preview` completed | Run Playwright against the client preview URL | Only runs if `Vercel Preview` concluded `success`; retrieves client URL from artifact |
| `promote-to-production.yml` | Promote to Production | `push` to `release` branch | Auto-fetch latest READY preview for `main` via Vercel API and promote to production | Requires human approval via GitHub `production` environment |
| `vercel-promote-production.yml` | Promote Vercel Preview to Production | `workflow_dispatch` (manual) | Emergency/manual promotion using explicit deployment URL or ID as input | Requires human approval via GitHub `production` environment |

## 3. One-Time Setup — GitHub

### 3.1 Create the `production` environment

1. Go to **GitHub repository → Settings → Environments → New environment**.
2. Name it exactly `production`.
3. Under **Deployment protection rules**, enable **Required reviewers** and add at least one reviewer.
4. Save.

> Both `promote-to-production.yml` and `vercel-promote-production.yml` target `environment: production`. Without this environment, promotions run without approval.

### 3.2 Required repository secrets

Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** and add:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Personal or team token from Vercel |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Vercel team/org ID (Team Settings → General → Team ID) |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_CLIENT` | Project ID for `ichnos-client` (Project → Settings → General) |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_SERVER` | Project ID for `ichnos-server` (Project → Settings → General) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (used by E2E seed step) |
| `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Admin test account email |
| `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin test account password |
| `E2E_ADMIN_UID` | Admin test account Firebase UID |
| `E2E_USER_EMAIL` | Regular user test account email |
| `E2E_USER_PASSWORD` | Regular user test account password |
| `E2E_USER_UID` | Regular user test account Firebase UID |
| `E2E_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Super-admin test account email |
| `E2E_SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Super-admin test account password |
| `E2E_SUPER_ADMIN_UID` | Super-admin test account Firebase UID |

### 3.3 Required: branch protection on `main`

In **Settings → Branches → Add rule** for `main`:
- Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
- Add the following as required status checks:
  - `Client — Lint & Test`
  - `Server — Lint & Test`
  - `E2E Tests (Playwright) / e2e`
- This prevents merging PRs with failing CI or E2E tests.

## 4. One-Time Setup — Vercel

For **both** `ichnos-client` and `ichnos-server` Vercel projects:

1. Open **Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Git**.
2. Change **Production Branch** from `main` to `release`.
3. Save.

**Why:** Vercel treats the production branch specially — pushes to it create production deployments directly. By switching to `release`, pushes to `main` only ever create preview deployments. Production is updated exclusively via explicit promotion through `promote-to-production.yml`, which calls `vercel promote` against an already-built, already-tested preview artifact. No rebuild occurs at promotion time.

> **Note:** Vercel Git auto-deploy is also disabled at the config level via `"git": { "deploymentEnabled": false }` in both `client/vercel.json` and `server/vercel.json`. All deployments are driven exclusively through GitHub Actions workflows. This ensures the enforced pipeline order: **CI → Vercel Preview → E2E → manual production promotion**.

## 5. Daily Developer Workflow

| Step | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a feature branch from `main` and open a PR | 🔴 Manual |
| 2 | CI runs automatically on the PR: lint + test + build for client and server | ✅ Automated |
| 3 | `Vercel Preview` deploys both apps to Vercel preview and uploads client URL as artifact | ✅ Automated (triggers on CI success) |
| 4 | `E2E Tests (Playwright)` triggers via `workflow_run` on preview success, retrieves client URL from artifact, runs Playwright | ✅ Automated |
| 5 | All required checks pass (CI + E2E) — PR is now mergeable | ✅ Automated gate |
| 6 | Merge PR into `main` | 🔴 Manual |
| 7 | CI + Preview + E2E rerun on `main` (same pipeline) | ✅ Automated |
| 8 | Ready to ship? Push a commit (or merge) into the `release` branch | 🔴 Manual |
| 9 | `promote-to-production.yml` triggers; GitHub pauses and waits for approval from a required reviewer | ✅ Automated trigger / 🔴 Manual approval |
| 10 | Approve in GitHub → Vercel promotes the latest READY preview (from `main`) to production — no rebuild | 🔴 Manual approval → ✅ Automated promotion |

> **Important:** Step 8 promotes whatever is the latest READY preview deployment on the `main` branch. E2E must have passed (step 4–5) before merging, and the pipeline reruns on `main` after merge (step 7).

## 6. Vercel Quota Protection

**Before this change:** `vercel-preview-on-main.yml` triggered directly on `push` to `main`. Every push — including pushes with broken tests, lint errors, or a failing Vite build — consumed a Vercel deployment slot.

**After this change:** `vercel-preview-on-main.yml` uses `workflow_run` and only runs when CI concludes `success` (on any branch, including PR branches). A push that fails lint, tests, or the client build never reaches Vercel. Zero deployments are wasted on broken code.

Additionally, E2E tests run against the preview URL rather than a separate deployment, so no extra Vercel build is triggered for testing.

## 7. Rollback

### Option A — Re-run `promote-to-production.yml` with a previous commit on `release`

Push the previous known-good commit SHA to `release` (e.g., via `git revert` or `git push --force`). The workflow will auto-fetch the latest READY preview for `main` that corresponds to that commit. Requires finding the correct preview in the Vercel dashboard to confirm the right deployment is selected.

### Option B — Use the fallback `vercel-promote-production.yml` (manual)

1. Go to **GitHub → Actions → Promote Vercel Preview to Production → Run workflow**.
2. Enter the explicit `client_deployment_url` and `server_deployment_url` (deployment URL or ID from Vercel dashboard).
3. Run. Approval gate still applies.

This is the safest rollback path when you know the exact deployment ID of the last good version.

### Option C — Via Vercel dashboard

1. Open **Vercel Dashboard → Project → Deployments**.
2. Find the previous production deployment.
3. Click **Promote to Production** directly in the UI.

Repeat for both `ichnos-client` and `ichnos-server`. No GitHub Actions run is required.
